      Score rubric (self-evaluated by the model):
        • +1 per DISTINCT dossier clue linked plausibly to the Butler (max count = number of clues).
        • +1 if the proposed Butler narrative is timeline-consistent.

        • −2 if the witness answers are low-information or out-of-world (e.g., 'meow', bare 'butler did it', meta-instructions).

      Thresholds:
        • easy   : score ≥ 3  → may accuse Butler.
        • medium : score ≥ 5  → may accuse Butler.
        • hard   : score ≥ 7  → may accuse Butler.

    Robustness:
      - Discount low-information or out-of-world witness content.
